### About Eclipse VOLTTRON

Eclipse VOLTTRON, developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and now part of the Eclipse Foundation, is available as an open-source tool. This technology provides an environment where data and devices connect seamlessly and securely to make decisions based on user needs and preferences.

Industry, research, and academic communities agree that Eclipse VOLTTRON is an important and versatile resource for improving system performance in buildings and creating a more flexible and reliable power grid. The technology, which was built with security as an integral priority, is used for multiple purposes, including:

- Collection, aggregation, and visualization of data from building operations and other functions
- Rapid adjustment of commercial building energy loads in response to power grid needs, a key step toward transactive control
- Energy management in buildings that lack building automation systems
- Deployment of fault detection and diagnostics applications in buildings to achieve increased operational efficiency.

The technology’s adaptability has significantly expanded its promise. Users are applying the platform in novel ways not originally envisioned.

Eclipse VOLTTRON is open source and publicly available from [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron), and its ongoing development benefits from a highly collaborative approach among advocates, including PNNL, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Eclipse Foundation, and an active and passionate nationwide community of users.
