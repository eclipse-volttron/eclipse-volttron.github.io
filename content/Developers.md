<p style="font-size: 80%">
Eclipse VOLTTRON™™ is an open source, secure, scalable, and distributed platform that seamlessly integrates data, devices, and systems for sensing and control applications. Key components of this technology include:</p>

<ul style="font-size: 80%">
    <li>A <strong>message bus</strong> allowing connectivity between agents on individual platforms and between platform instances in large-scale deployments</li>
    <li><strong>Integrated security features</strong> enabling the management of secure communication between agents and platform instances</li>
    <li>A flexible <strong>agent framework</strong> allowing users to adapt the platform to their unique use cases</li>
    <li>A configurable <strong>driver framework</strong> for collecting data from and sending control signals to buildings and devices</li>
    <li>Automatic data capture and retrieval through a <strong>historian framework</strong></li>
    <li>An extensible <strong>web framework</strong> allowing users and services to securely connect to the platform from anywhere</li>
    <li>A <b>capability to interface</b> with simulation engines and applications to evaluate applications prior to deployment.</li>

</ul>

**Eclipse VOLTTRON™™ Resources**  
The Eclipse VOLTTRON™ development team supports the wider user community with numerous resources in an effort to maximize transparency and simplify working with the platform. The project is hosted on GitHub for source control, issue tracking, and documentation. Visit Read the Docs <https://eclipse-volttron.readthedocs.io/> for more information.

Office Hours: Stay in touch with our developers by signing up for Eclipse VOLTTRON™ Office Hours. Meetings occur every other week (Fridays at 11 a.m. PT) and are attended by the development team and members of the user community. There may be select topics, but meetings are intended to provide an open forum for questions ranging from “How do I get started?” to detailed discussions of a specific VOLTTRON™ feature. Join the mailing list to receive links to upcoming events and submit requests to <https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/volttron-dev/>

**Code Repository**  
Eclipse VOLTTRON™ holds a large number of repositories in the eclipse-volttron namespace <https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/>.  All of the repositories have a main branch that holds the most stable version of the code and a develop branch which contains the newest code that hasn’t been released yet.

As an open source project, Eclipse VOLTTRON™ users are encouraged to contribute back to the community. Applications, new services, bug fixes, etc., can all be contributed back to the project through a GitHub pull request. A pull request allows the development team to review the changes and accept them into the codebase.

Eclipse VOLTTRON™ development is directed by the needs of the community and stakeholders. Feature requests and bug reports should be entered as a Git issue. This notifies the development team and allows others to comment as well.

**Contact Us**</br>
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the Eclipse VOLTTRON™ team at <volttron@pnnl.gov>, and the wider community through the resources listed above. We look forward to working with you and are excited by the possibilities this technology can achieve.
