&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>"</b>ACE IoT Solutions utilizes Eclipse VOLTTRON, a cost-effective open-source platform as a key part of ACE Aerodrome,
a data collection, management, and visualization platform. Utilizing ACE Aerodrome, customers acquire, process, store, and analyze data to meet their
energy efficiency and building operation optimization objectives. ACE IoT’s current customers range from hospitals, office buildings and schools to
multi-family residential buildings, smart greenhouses and even an MLB stadium. PNNL’s FY25 priorities for Eclipse VOLTTRON, including the development of 
enhanced tooling for deploying the modularized code base with additional utility signal integration will help streamline deployment and management of ACE Aerodrome
and expand the viable deployment environments to include medium and smaller-sized buildings – a critical 
objective on the way to achieving the DoE’s 2050 decarbonization goals.<b>"</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>"</b>Since 2021, Volttron has played a significant role within EPRI’s energy storage research. The open source nature of the tool paired with its enthusiastic and 
supportive community have allowed EPRI researchers to efficiently and affordably implement this technology within our controls, emerging energy storage technology, and microgrid 
research. Although EPRI’s current use cases (energy storage system controls) are not technically within Volttron’s  smart building automation scope, the tool has proven more than capable in these contexts <b>"</b>
