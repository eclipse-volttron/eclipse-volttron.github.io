Eclipse VOLTTRON™, with Modbus and BACnet implementations, enables gathering and dispositioning of data.


Eclipse VOLTTRON™ provides a secure way to examine data, reveal useful information and deliver solutions. This technology can readily retrieve data from devices and coordinate analysis, offering analytics firms and other potential users unique opportunities to add value.  

With Eclipse VOLTTRON™, data, devices and decisions connect seamlessly and securely based on user needs and preferences.

**Rivers of Data**</br>
Devices of all kinds are producing vast amounts of data every minute of the day, but often the data is not effectively mined for information that could lead to improved knowledge, better processes and, perhaps, more profitable outcomes. Eclipse VOLTTRON™ offers capabilities for any type of device from which there’s a reason to collect and use data, and includes Modbus and BACnet implementations. The open-source, proprietary aspects of Eclipse VOLTTRON™ help make it cost-effective.

**A Versatile, Safe Data Tool**</br>
The Eclipse VOLTTRON™ software platform and associated applications collect data and either analyze it locally or push to the cloud for storage and subsequent analysis. This technology’s strong security foundation helps ensure that data is protected from external threats.
