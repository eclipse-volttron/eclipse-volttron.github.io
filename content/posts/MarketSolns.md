[ILC](https://www.pnnl.gov/intelligent-load-control) was created as part of the PNNL-led [Clean Energy and Transactive Campus](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/clean-energy-and-transactive-campus) project, an effort initially funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Washington State. ILC offers three primary buildings-grid capabilities: capacity bidding, which incentivizes targeted consumption reductions; transactive energy methods for enabling a rapid negotiation process between buildings and the grid; and peak power load management.

**Impact**: The technology’s peak power load management capability has rapidly dropped electricity demand in buildings by 10 to 20 percent, reducing grid stress while maintaining occupant comfort within an acceptable range. ILC has been successfully deployed in multiple buildings at PNNL, at the University of Toledo, in two Washington, D.C. commercial buildings, and will be central to two DOE [Connected Communities projects](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/pnnl-helps-build-connected-communities) in 2024. Next: PNNL will make ILC operational in its campus buildings to coordinate with the City of Richland’s utility in mitigating peak load constraints.
