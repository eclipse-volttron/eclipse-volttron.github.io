**Bringing home the savings!**</br>
Connected home devices—such as smart appliances and security systems—are projected to grow their market share significantly. However, many smart technologies lack connections to their community and the power grid. Truly connected smart homes should not only benefit their occupants, they should also benefit the community as a whole by helping strengthen the grid and by building a more resilient and reliable utility network. Eclipse VOLTTRON™™ makes this possible.

**Efficiency, Savings, Comfort**</br>

hot water or other functions, Eclipse VOLTTRON™™ enables features that result in improved energy efficiency, cost savings, and convenience.

With Eclipse VOLTTRON™™, data, devices, and decisions connect seamlessly and securely based on user needs and preferences.
